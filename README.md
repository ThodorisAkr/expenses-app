# expenses-app

Following Udemy React course which is linked below, I made a simple expenses app which shows to the user
expenses in a chart which be filtered by year, while also a new expense can be added. 
This app utilizes the following React's basic concepts:

- State and useState Hook
- Wrapper Components
- Parent to Child Communication
- Bottom-up Communication
- Two-way binding
- Lifting State Up
- Rendering Lists and Conditional Content

Udemy Course: [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WbyAEYdcl5bRXkF/)

To start the app use `npm install` in terminal to install the node-modules first then `npm start`
